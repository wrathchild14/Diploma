Notes 13.6.2022:
- Developers are reluctant to ship a game that has not been completely tested and the risk of an evolutionary algorithm learning something wrong is too high.

[Task] - Do the example for the computer to get to the GOAL with the 3rd person unity sample.

[1. problem] active input handling - was set to 'Input System package' in 'Player Settings'
[Solution] changed it to both.

[Commands]
- `mlagents-learn config/MoveToGoal.yaml (--initialize-from=MoveToGoal) --run-id=MoveToGoal(--force)`
- `mlagents-learn config/MoveToGoal.yaml --run-id=MoveToGoalv2 --force`
- `tensorboard --logdir`

NO -base for third person player finding the goal of a maze? done. need to implement it with Agent class-
